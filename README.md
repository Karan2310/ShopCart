#ShopCart

The Shop Cart project primarily centers around its frontend components, aiming to create an engaging and user-friendly interface. It achieves this by interacting with the FakeStore API, which serves as the source of the products displayed on the platform. To efficiently handle the application's state, the project leverages the Context API, an approach that streamlines the management of data across various components.

One noteworthy aspect of this project is the attention to detail when replicating the design. Every effort has been made to closely mimic the original design, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience for users. Additionally, the project places significant emphasis on responsiveness, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. This enhances the accessibility and usability of the application, catering to a wider range of users.

In essence, the Shop Cart project goes beyond simple frontend development. It encompasses the integration of external data through API calls, employs advanced state management techniques through the Context API, and places a strong emphasis on design fidelity and responsiveness to provide an exceptional user experience.
